				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>In the industrial age, many technologies replaced the human especially in large 
					industries where chain work and Taylorization are already outdated concepts. 
					Indeed, machines currently have large capabilities in technology to perform 
					repetitive tasks with high speed and very high accuracy. But will these machines, 
					less expensive for industries than men, replace all the branches of business in 
					the future ? Industry was the first to be pointed by these new technologies, but 
					have the tertiary and quaternary sectors been already affected ?
				</p><br><p>
					First of all, we’ll present the current state of affairs, namely jobs which 
					have been already replaced by new technologies. Then we’ll study technological 
					innovations that are going to make this job transformation possible. Then we’ll 
					analyze the modern evolutions of our jobs, and what human work will like with 
					this automation. Last but not least, we would like to discuss the ethical issues 
					and the sociological consequences of these transformations.

				<h3>Part I</h3><h4>
					 How does the technologies influence the human’s works and jobs over the time? 
					 Does the different advancement in technology decreased the number of humans jobs? 
					 Let’s try to answer those questions.
				</h4><br><p>
					   First, there is an important point, which is the evolution of the number 
					   of human on earth. It’s a good point to start, because many years ago, 
					   there was not as many people as actually. In 1500, there were only 275 
					   million people on earth and we are actually close to 7.5 billion <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. And 
					   the more the people there are, the more work is needed. And mainly to feed 
					   the entire population. As an example, we can go back in the medieval ages, 
					   during which the peasants were working extremely hard <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[2]</sup></a> every day (except 
					   in the holy days). And when there is more mouth to feed, it needs more work, 
					   so more people at work and so on.
				</p><br><br>
					<div class="image" style="background-image:
					url('http://www.etransformation.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Industrial_robots.jpg');
					width: calc(810px / 2);
					height:calc(579px / 2); 
					margin-left: 23vw;
					float:left;" />http://www.etransformation.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Industrial_robots.jpg
				</div>

				<br style="clear: both;"><br><br><p>
					   And because the work was too hard, some genius invented instruments and mechanism
					    that helps workers. So that was a good way of the technology. But because the 
					    work was less hard, patron doesn’t need as many employees [10]. It’s valid for 
					    our contemporary age, but it was exactly the same during the middle ages for example. 
					    It doesn’t mean people had no longer a job, because new one were created, mainly in 
					    the manufacturing of mechanisms and machines (for farmers especially) so it balances 
					    the balance. But during the industrial revolution <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[3]</sup></a> (1750-1830), mechanization 
					    was a big problem for the factory’s workers, because the machines starting to build 
					    machines instead of human building machines [9]. It does not stop groups or factory 
					    to increase the production in an ethical way <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[5]</sup></a> (ethic of technologies is explained 
					    in part 4). And technologies ended slave labor, it’s a really important point in favor 
					    of machines. But there are two points of view, the ones that said that there are less 
					    and less jobs, and the ones that said the opposite.
				</p><br><p>
						Some articles maintain that new technologies do not only help people at work, but they 
						steal their work. A French example of how the new technologies seem bad is the case of 
						the Glassworkers of Carmaux in south of France. In this case, the factory wanted to 
						replace a major part of its workers by machines, but all the employees made a group 
						of unionized workers to protest for their know-how (but globally the human know-how 
						instead of the automatic machines) <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. In the 
						article “The end of work” <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, one of 
						the arguments is that politics are lying about the fact that relocation of factory steal 
						European jobs, but in fact it’s a relocation with automation, so it’s not Chinese (for 
						example) who “steal” the jobs.
				</p><br><p>
						At the opposite, some articles are explaining why technologies do not steal workers’ jobs. 
						It can be a kind of frustration, that machines make our jobs, Bernhard J. Stern is explaining 
						it in one of his articles <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, and how it has an impact on 
						the population psychologies 
						(psychologies related to technologies is developed in part 4). An interesting study shows 
						that technology create more jobs than it has destroyed, and also shows the advantages of 
						the technologies as the fact that Hard, dangerous and dull jobs have declined.
				</p><br><p>
						Examples of jobs that have been replaced are all types of craftsmanship, also delivery driver, 
						and some kind of soldiers. But there are not many jobs that have totally disappeared, the majority 
						of the “disappeared” or “almost-disappeared” had their effective that have decreased by 90%. How will 
						it evolve in the future…?

					Part II : </h3><h4>
					We will evoke here the jobs that will soon disappear, or at least 
					that will be automated.
				</h4><br><p>
					All humans need tools to survive. It’s for this reason that he created 
					tools that were more and more powerful, strong and useful. These tools 
					are good to replace the humans’ labor.
				</p><br><p>
					For example, the invention of the plow made it possible to replace the 
					man by the oxen. From wheel to steam engines, these tools have greatly 
					simplified human work. Today I’m talking about the replacement of human 
					by machines in many jobs <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. An economic revolution is coming. For many 
					years, digital technology has continued to grow and many computer and 
					electronic engineers are working on the automation of many tasks previously 
					performed by humans.
				</p><br><br>

				</div>

				<br style="clear: both;"><br><br><p>
					
					Previously, engineers created robots capable of performing predefined tasks in a 
					specific order. This inexpensive method is fast to implement, and minimizes the 
					risk of losing control of the machine, as each action is planned and programmed. 
					Today, we are looking for multi-tasking robots. These robots are able to adapt 
					their behavior to situations depending on what we asked them to do. These robots 
					are able to learn new things, they have the ability to train themselves in many jobs. 
					They are not programmed for a particular jobs <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.

				</p><br><p>
					Robots are more and more replacing jobs. For example, cash registers at the supermarket, 
					sellers in the United States or cash distributors/collectors in banks <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Coffee and 
					beverage dispensers are much faster and cheaper than the human equivalent, and the 
					quality is the same or even superior because they are controlled by hygiene standards 
					and always the same preparation <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.

				</p><br><p>
					In the United States for example, many autonomous cars (driverless car) are tested <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. 
					They can drive a person to a specific location, navigate with GPS technology, and move 
					safely in any environment with a camera on the roof of the vehicle. Some people can 
					argue with "But it's dangerous, what if the car has an accident?". I could answer that 
					the automates never blinks, it always respects the speeds’ limits and does not feel 
					tired. Although there is still a long way to go before mankind can trust machines, 
					these are statistically less dangerous than man himself.
				</p><br><p>
					According the to BBC <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, I can mention here the 5 jobs that have the biggest risks 
					(percentage) to disappear in the coming years : 
				</p><br><p>	
					- Telephone salesperson 99%
				</p><br><p>	
					- Typist or related keyboard worked 98.5%
				</p><br><p>	
					- Legal secretary 97.6%
				</p><br><p>	
					- Financial accounts manager 97.6%
				</p><br><p>	
					- Routine inspector and tester 97.6%
				</p><br><p>
					The list of this site is a very good indicator of the risks incurred before going 
					in a sector. And yet this kind of information is not given to young students, 
					which is a serious pity !<br>
					I talked about jobs that will disappear in the near future, but what will remain ? 
					What are the jobs that will be preserved? We will discuss it in the next part !

					Part III : </h3><h4> If everything is going to be automated, which 
					jobs will remain in the future ? What are the limits of Artificial 
					Intelligence ?
				</h4><br><p>
					The increase of automation and artificial intelligences in our workplaces 
					can be considered as something really efficient and much faster in our 
					industries.  So, we can wonder if humans will keep their jobs in the future... 
					(near or distant)

					Also, is there any limit to artificial intelligence ? Since his beginnings, AI is 
					subject to a non-stop progress, getting more and more closer to humans. In certain 
					circumstances, AI is almost smarter than us. For example, there are “super-intelligences”, 
					considered as already possessing an “intelligence far surpassing our minds”.
					<a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

				</p><br><p>
					Of course, the question of AIs limits hasn’t a precise answer nowadays, and is part of a lot of 
					discussions. But we could have a little idea of what the future holds. AI, may having the 
					possibility to surpass the man in all domains one day, will surely replace us in our jobs. 
					According to some scenarios, AI will become so powerful that the man won’t be able to stop 
					it, or even make the human disappear. Following certain forecasts, our computers will be 
					able to have the same performances than our brains in approximately 30 years or up to 40 
					years.<a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[4]</sup></a> 
				</p><br><p>
					If there must be one category of jobs remaining, it will be the purely theoretic jobs needing 
					a lot of thinking, intuition or even creativity, which are three things really hard to acquire 
					for a computer or an artificial intelligence. (For instance language teacher is a job needing 
					a lot of “intuition”)
				</p><br><p>
					For example, according to a report from Citibank (Feb. 2016), 47% of US jobs will may be touched 
					by the automation, showing that not all jobs will be replaced in a near future.

					Part IV</h3><h4>
					If men no longer have trades / need to work, what will be the psychological consequences?
				</h4><br><p>
					Robotization will dramatically change our economic laws and even more, it will transform our way of thinking.
					It is a reality when we speak about the disparition of work but what will human become ?
					When human was ejected from the Garden of Eden, he was condemned to work and toil to survive.
					As time pass, mankind continued to progress technologically, from the invention of steam engine to 
					the electric motor. Human constantly creates and invents robots and machines to stop working anymore.
					<a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
				</p><br><p>
					We have seen previously that these changes are significant, what are the 
					psychological consequences ?
                </p><br><p>
					Since 2001, nearly 800 000 jobs have disappeared in the United Kingdom. 
					These changes are present all over the world. In the UK, 11 milions of jobs 
					have a high chance of being replaced by robotics in the coming years.
					<a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
				</p><br><p>
					Richard and Daniel Susskin, two professors of Oxford, have written a book<a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[2]</sup></a> collecting 
					their analysis on the future changes of work in the world. In an Internet society, 
					we will neither need nor want doctors, teachers, accountants, architects, the clergy, 
					consultants, lawyers, and many others, to work as they did in the 20th century. 
					But previously, the industrial revolution create jobs. The modernization of work leads 
					to new jobs, but this is no longer the case today. Technological progress is no longer 
					a synonymous of job creation<a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. These potential 
					new jobs will not be accessible for everyone. 
					Everybody can't become engineers or want to become engineers. These jobs will no longer be 
					accessible to all humans. You can not train a baker to become a computer engineer.
				</p><br><p>
					But what are we going to do with all these people who are not engineers, or who does 
					not like math or computer science ?
					Time will tell whether the human will destroy himself after all these technological 
					advances ? Or if the machine will surpass humans, until they are no longer useful 
					for the machine ?

					It is highly possible that in the coming years the concept of work will be greatly changed. 
					Work will no longer be necessary for man to survive. The machine will replace it in almost 
					all the work. But what are we going to do? I think that art and leisure will be the basis of 
					our society. Wherever man has no pleasure in working, he will be able to devote himself to 
					his favorite activities. <a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
				</p><br><p>
					The introduction of a universal income would initially allow man to support himself while 
					having more work. In a second step, the concept of money will be over. Indeed, machines 
					create a profit, but do not ask for money, no salary is paid to them. As a result, the 
					price of the goods will be equivalent to the price of the materials that have allowed its 
					manufacture, hence a creation and consumption of wealth at very low prices.
				</p><br><p>
					We can finish this last part on a subject that demands reflection: Who are the men who will 
					continue to work for pleasure, will not we fall into an inactive state as in the animated 
					film "Wall-E"<a href="#Conclusion"><sup>[6]</sup></a> ?

					Conclusion
				</h3>
					</p><br><p>
						To conclude this Wiki, It seems that the evolution of AI will be endless. Of course, 
						most repetitive jobs will disappear but as we said before, jobs that require intuition 
						and theoretical research will remain longer than the others (and maybe never be replaced 
						?). But automation will also create new jobs (machine maintenance, etc.) so there are also 
						positive sides to this transformation.
					</p><br><p>
						It is obvious that in the next years, work robotization and automation will upset the 
						economic system worldwide. We will enter a brand new economic era, our way of acting, 
						consuming and the way of producing will totally change.
					</p><br><p>
						What will humans become ? Will they eventually be surpassed by the superior efficiency 
						and intelligence of machines and their AIs ? The future will give us the answer, but it 
						is sure that our generation will know the premises of this new era and will have to face 
						a radical change in their way of thinking and acting.
